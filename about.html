    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div class="about">
        This platform was born as a result of discussion among few Navodayans. We felt, based on the trends of choice of colleges, that a lots
        of Navodayans are not going to as good colleges as they are capable of. We found that one of the main reasons for this was lack of
        proper guidance and misconceptions.<br>
        This platform aspires to provide a platform over which seniors from JNVs can help younger Navodayans to choose their career wisely.
        This is not another platform for photo and memory sharing but a way to pour in love for the alma mater and society via actions.
